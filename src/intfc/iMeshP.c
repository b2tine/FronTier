/** \brief Populate a mesh instance and a partition by reading data from files.
 *

 *  specified file, inserts entities into the mesh instance, constructs
 *  parts within the partition, and inserts entities into the parts.
 *  Options allow n>=1 files on p processes.
 *  Optional capabilities of iMeshP_loadAll include computing an initial
 *  partition (e.g., if a serial mesh file without part assignments is read)
 *  and creating ghost entities as requested by the application; the
 *  availability of these options is implementation dependent.
 *
 *  COMMUNICATION:  Collective.
