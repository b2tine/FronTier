The generalized inverse gaussian distribution and generalized hyperbolic distribution random number generators are implemented.

in-gig-{1,2,3} are input file for generalized inverse gaussian distribution;
in-gh-{1,2,3} are input file for generalized hyperbolic distribution. 

Example: To generate generalized hyperbolic distribution with input in-gh-1
command: mrun gh-1

Output: out-gh-1
	contain following files: 
	run-output (original)
	soln-0.xg (original)
	exact-0.xg (added, plot the shape based on exact density formula)

Use command: xgraph soln-0.xg exact-0.xg
	to compare the exact results and generated results

added or revised functions:
	In src/util/random.c
	(1) double dist_gig(POINTER,unsigned short int)
	(2) double dist_gh(POINTER,unsigned short int)

	In MonteCarlo.cpp
	(1) static void makeGIGdensityPlot(PARAMS*,char*,int,double*,double*,int,double);
	(2) static void makeGHdensityPlot(PARAMS*,char*,int,double*,double*,int,double);
	Note: These above two are for tests use which plot density functions
	(3) static void readMonteCarloParams(PARAMS*,char*);

	In MonteCarlo.h
	(1) enum _RANDOM_TYPE

	In src/util/cdecs.h
	(1) struct _GIG_PARAMS
	(2) struct _GH_PARAMS

	In src/util/uprotos.h
	Line 221-222 add declaration for
	(1) IMPORT double dist_gig(POINTER,unsigned short int*);
	(2) IMPORT double dist_gh(POINTER,unsigned short int*);
