The crystal code is a FronTier application. In order to compile this
program, one needs mpi library (mpich or openmpi), PETSc library which
can be downloaded at:

http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/

Other OPTIONAL accompanying packages include HDF4:

http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf4/

and GD:

http://www.libgd.org/Main_Page

The configure line for compiling crystal under FronTier is:

configure --with-openmpi=(mpi-dir) --with-petsc=(petsc-dir) --with-devel [--with-hdf=(hdf-dir)] [--with-gd=(gd-dir)]

Compile FronTier library under FronTier first, and then:

cd crystal
make

to make the crystal excutable.
