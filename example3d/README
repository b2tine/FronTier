This is a directory containing 3D examples of using front tracking
libary and its basic functionalities. 

If the FronTier library was configured in serial,
the Makefile will automatically compile examples in serial; if the
FronTier library is compiled in parallel, the Makefile in this
directory will automatically compile examples in parallel.

To run an example in serial:

1. compile the FronTier library.

2. copy example[n].c to example.c and make.

3. execute the program.

For example:
   cp example01.c example.c
   make
   example -o output01
   
4. The code can also restart from a step of previous run. For example,
if the user has saved the file in previous run with name:

output.ts0000100

He can restart the run with the command:

example -o output.r -r output -t 100

here output.r is the new output name, output is the restart name and 100 
is the step at which the data was saved.

To run an example in parallel, the user needs to compile the FronTier
library in parallel. This can be done in configure:

configure --with-mpich={path to mpich}
To run an example in parallel, the user needs to compile the FronTier
library in parallel. This can be done in configure:

configure --with-mpich={path to mpich} [other options]
or 
configure --with-openmpi={path to openmpi} [other options]

The run command is:

mpirun -np num_nodes example -p nx ny nz -o out-name

For example:

mpirun -np 8 example -p 2 2 2 -o output

to restart:

mpirun -np 8 example -p 2 2 2 -o output.r -r output -t 100
