All the input files in this directory are about special cases during the 
parachute inflation process, such as uneven equilibrium string length, 
breaking string at some time.
Here is some discription about them.

1. Files with keyword "uneven" are cases where the equilibrium length of 
some strings is not equal to others. They are stretched at the initial state.

2. You can specify
   1.) the uneven coefficient (default is 1.0 which means all equal)
       "Enter uneven coefficient:",
   2.) number of strings with different equilibrium length
       "Enter number of uneven strings:",
   3.) specific string IDs of strings with different equilibrium length
       "Enter ID of uneven strings:".
If 3.) is not specified in the inputfile, the default is the first n strings,
where n is the number of strings set to be uneven.

3. Files with keyword "break" are cases where some strings broken in the 
middle of parachute inflation process.

4. You can specify 
   1.) the time to break string in the input file with the line 
       "Enter time to break strings:",
   2.) number of strings to break with the line 
       "Enter number of strings to break:",
   3.) specific string IDs to break with the line
       "Enter ID of strings to break:".
If 3.) is not specified in the inputfile, the default is the first n strings, 
where n is the number of strings to break.

5. Input files with suffix "-1" means the string IDs are specified, while 
these without such suffix means the string IDs are not specified.
